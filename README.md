**ND_Core to SnailyCAD Bridge**

This is a rough implementation and might not work for everyone (my apologies in advance). 
However, I believe it's better to share this code so others can use it as a starting point and improve it further, rather than having to build everything from scratch.

Requirements:
- SnailyCAD: The cad system to accept the data (the code could be modified to other cads but wasnt here)
- ND_Core: The framework to provide the data
- Ox_Lib: Used for handling notifications during registration.
- Bryan_Snaily: Enables direct interfacing with SnailyCAD.

Support:
Please note that I can't promise any support for this bridge. I don't actively develop for FiveM anymore â€” I'm just refining some of my older code as I transition away.
